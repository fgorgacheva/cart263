## Artist's Statement

For this final project, I decided to pursue my initial midterm idea, as explained in the proposal. As the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling is one of my favorite of all time, I was inspired to use the theme to make this project. 

Initially, I meant to go through the sorting ceremony, but subsequently decided to add more components to my game that would bring out recognizable aspects of the movies and of that magical world using what we learned this semester in P5.js and Javascript itself.

Firstly, the sorting ceremony is unique and exciting. Every child has wished for an owl to bring them their admission letter and to know which house they would belong to. So even though in the movie, the sorting hat seems to be talking to itself, it is probably probing the mind of the wearer to evaluate which house the wearer belongs in. It's never certain what the answer might be and the hat might find things about the wearer they didn't know themselves. So by making the player answer a few strange questions, it allows them to feel like the sorting hat is probing the mind of the player to then decide which house to place them in. It's exciting to answer the questions to then see where we end up!

Following this, I created paths. The house that the user is sorted in will change the path the player follows throughout the game. They will meet a famous character from that house, and end their day in that house's common room. It is to make the user feel like they really are at Hogwarts, sorted into their own house and interacting with the various characters from the movies.

After the ceremony and enjoying the banquet the night before, the player wakes up to a brand new day and their very first day of magical classes. The usesr can pick any class in any order. The goal of the classes is to bring out a little bit of the magic. In the potions class, we get the Snape that we all know and love: cold and uncaring, and we get to either make a potion following the recipe, or to fail it and earn the resentment of the professor. The flying class, though the user cannot actually fly on a broom, they can press the space bar to stay afloat and meet the goal. As we all know, first years are not expected to know how to fly on a broomstick and they're being taught how to use one. That minigame is meant to reflect that by only requiring the user to stay up for 10 seconds. Baby steps! Last but not least, the charms class, which I was able to bring as closely as possible to actual magic. Professor Flitwick, teaches the player how to cast the spell and the player must repeat it. If the player fails to cast the spell correctly, they must keep trying until it works, and once it works, the feather will float, just like in the movie! 

Although looking a little cartoonish, I wanted to make the user feel part of that world even just a little bit by making magic happen and by interacting with the well known characters and feeling the excitment of belonging to a Hogwarts House!
